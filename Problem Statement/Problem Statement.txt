* Deaths you have to predict the gaps and as soon as you have the data for deaths you can get the confirmed cases from CFR ratio 
*  Any exteranl factors that you might think may affect the prediction you can use like temperature or so but you have to provide a clear explaination for the same
* Case fatality ratio= (death / confirmed )* 100
* Provide a single CSV file with all the predictions
